0,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,James Luxford,City AM,3/3/2022,40,"I guess its always been hard for me to see the positive side of things Drac admits during a heart-to-heart with Johnny. Its a sentiment many will share while watching, as the most paper-thin of franchises lumbers to its final resting place."
1,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Mat Brunet,AniMat's Review (YouTube),15/02/2022,30,Hotel Transylvania: Transformania is a presentation of everything thats wrong with the Hotel Transylvania franchise by amplifying all of its problems to deliver a miserably tiring experience.
2,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Robert Levin,Newsday,29/01/2022,75,The conceit still works well enough to mostly distract from the tired adventure movie plot.
3,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Jackie K. Cooper,jackiekcooper.com,28/01/2022,60,"No Adam Sandler this time out, but the animated fun is still there."
4,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Asher Luberto,The Playlist,28/01/2022,74,"It's not likely we'll see another one of these things, but if you ask me, another stay at Transylvania wouldn't be so bad."
5,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Chris Sawin,Hub Pages,22/01/2022,30,A lukewarm sendoff that mostly feels like a lethargic attempt to recapture its former glory. It's built around an entertaining concept that it doesn't fully capitalize on. It ultimately obliterates character traits for trite gags and clichÃ© punch lines.
6,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Doug Walker,Channel Awesome,21/01/2022,75,"Starts off sloppy, but brings a fair amount of comedy, imagery, and creative animation as it continues on."
7,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Debopriyaa Dutta,Screen Rant,21/01/2022,60,"Genuinely fun and touching in parts, Hotel Transylvania: Transformania casts familiar characters in new molds, adding more heart to the franchise."
8,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Kevin Harley,Radio Times,20/01/2022,40,"Four films in, perhaps it's time to hang up the cape."
9,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Laura Hiros,RincÃ³n de cine,20/01/2022,60,A nice to spend some time with family. [Full review in Spanish]
10,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Andrea Chase,Killer Movie Reviews,20/01/2022,20,A relentlessly obvious and overplayed exercise in draining the last dregs from a moribund franchise.
11,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Will Ashton,The Young Folks,19/01/2022,50,"Outside of this charming performance and several notable new character designs, Hotel Transylvania: Transformania is a lackluster conclusion to an animated series that never quite stood out much."
12,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Sandie Angulo Chen,Common Sense Media,18/01/2022,60,This supposedly final movie about Drac and Mavis' monster family and their silly adventures is sure to make little ones laugh and adults feel nostalgic for monster movies of old.
13,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Peter Canavese,Celluloid Dreams,18/01/2022,50,"Entirely conventional; runs on slapstick and action, with all the humor of an old Scooby-Doo episode."
14,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Julian Lytle,idobi.com,18/01/2022,69,Hotel Transylvania: Transformania is an ok-at-best sequel in this series. It's funny enough and is probably a good waste of time on a lazy weekend afternoon with your family at home.
15,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Kevin A. Ranson,MovieCrypt.com,17/01/2022,25,"... like a made-for-television afterthought... The once-fun spooky adventure has been purged, leaving a continuous series of so-so silliness, and the unfulfilled characters appear just as disappointed by it."
16,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Allison Rose,FlickDirect,17/01/2022,70,"As the fourth film in the Hotel Transylvania series, Transformania continues to keep its foundation rooted in the first movie."
17,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,15/01/2022,37.5,"When you've resigned yourself to the tiresome body switch storyline, it's time to say goodbye."
18,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Eddie Harrison,film-authority.com,15/01/2022,60,...still feels cut from the same cloth as the first three films....
19,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Kevin Carr,Fat Guys at the Movies,15/01/2022,62.5,It's a great horror movie primer for kids.
20,HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA: TRANSFORMANIA,Chris Knight,National Post,14/01/2022,60,"The kids should enjoy it, and parents who want to watch along won't be turning into monsters themselves."
